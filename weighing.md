Weights were assigned to each function concerning how important each analysis is to it. Then, the scores determined from the analyses are weighed accordingly. For example, elderly and family dwellings were given higher weights for view and sunlight compared to student dwellings. Public functions were given relatively low weights overall for view and sun because those variables were deemed fairly unimportant for the needs of those spaces. From these assigned weights, weighted products (wp) were created per function.

The assigned weights per function are as follows:

The pre-calculated wp values and relationship (REL) data were then used in our weighing algorithm, which places function seeds. The weighing algorithm finds the best location for each program element while respecting spatial relationships between the different functions.
