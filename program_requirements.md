## Project requirements
Yellowstone is designed to take into account the context of the urban environment, have a focus on environmental sustainability, and to provide maximum daylight to its residents as well as a balanced amount of sunlight (>2 hours but not too much). Greenery is also an important aspect of Yellowstone, and will be placed on the roof and on balconies, as well as in the frontal square, for its cooling effects and mental health benefits. Finally, while not a requirement, we found it important to give residents views of Rotterdam's stand-out architectural hotspots, as they contribure to a pleasant skyline.

## List of programs
Besides the 5 residential functions, there are 12 programs we added that are more public. For programs relating to food and socializing, we included a bar, a cafe, and working spaces. For health needs of the residents, there will be a care center, a physical therapy center (mainly for the elderly), and a gym. The supermarket is a useful public facility open to all. Additionally, bike and car parking are included, as many residents will have a need for one or both. The lobbies serve as functional spaces that connect to multiple programs and ways of circulating through the building. Lastly, Biergarten and Annabel are already existing programs that we will work into our procedure.
