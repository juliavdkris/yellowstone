We will now reflect on the process of creating Yellowstone, and consider what limitations impacted our results.

The process of creating our building gave insight into procedural design: how it requires careful thinking every step of the way, and how useful it truly is to not have to recalculate every step of the process when you change one detail. Another key takeaway was the experience that the Affinity team gained by working with each other -- multidisciplinary work is often not encountered in university classes, so it was definitely a unique and valuable learning experience to have that.

In terms of technological barriers that impeded upon the accuracy of the algorithms, the sun and hotspot analyses could be improved regarding the building not "blocking itself". This would provide more accurate inputs for the weighing and growth algorithms. We would also troubleshoot the problems that occurred when trying to incorporate the REL chart into the weighing algorithm.

Several of our initial design ideas fell through due to time constraints and barriers that were obstacles much too late in the process. This includes the curved corners as well as the idea of including an atrium as a central public space in the building. 

The current design is more of a large-scale concept than an in-depth plan of a building. There is refining to do, and also needed is the creation of detailed floor plans and circulation networks. And, if this project were to be implemented, there should be a aprticipatory planning process with the future residents of the building. We made educated guesses as to the needs and preferences of the user groups, but having direct input from those individuals would have the most beneficial impact on the design process and final building.
