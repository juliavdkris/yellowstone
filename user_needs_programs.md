## Vision
The transformation of Rotterdam in the following years presents a unique opportunity to develop buildings that align the municipality's goals for community engagement and environmental sustainability. Yellowstone will be home to 400 students, 200 elderly people, and 200 couples and families.Through carefully selected public facilities and shared spaces, the building fosters meaningful connections between residents while serving as a vital community hub in the Rotterdam of the future.
The mail goals of our project are:
- Social integration
- Views of Rotterdamâ€™s finest architecture
- Minimize sun blocking on surrounding buildings
- Minimize noise
- Keep biergarten intact

## Site location
The Schieblock in Rotterdam is our building site. It is well connected to the rest of the city by public transportation, and is a quick walk away from the Rotterdam Centraal train station. The site neighbors many entertainment venues that create a bustling atmosphere in the evening. We aim to integrate our building into this existing environment, while creating privacy for residents. To integrate with the surroundings, the biergarten  will be left untouched, and yellow stairs leading to our building's roof will connect directly to the Luchtsingel bridge. Additionally, the nearby Hofplein area will see significant development in the next several years, with projects such as RISE, which will add new high-rise residential buildings to the skyline, and the Hofplein park, a urban green area. The public square and connection to the Luchsingel bridge will add to this focus on pedestrian connectivity and access to urban green spaces.

## Design principles
Our building will feature two urban green spaces: the roof garden (1, 5) and the frontal square (3, 7). Yellowstone was designed with environemtal harmony in mind, aiming to maximize sunlight and views while minimizing noise pollution (2, 4). The building showcases curved corners and balconies, making it take on a smooth, organic look (6). Lastly, greenery will be incorporated into the balconies as well as the public green areas.
The design principles are shown visually below.
