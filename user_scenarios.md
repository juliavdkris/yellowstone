Our building will provide four types of residential homes: elderly: both independent and assisted (1-2p), student apartments (2, 4, or 8p), and starters: couples and small families (2-4p).

For imagining the daily lives of each of these user groups, we provide the following scenarios:

### Elderly
I live with my wife in a spacious, sun-filled apartment. Our neighbors include other older people like us, as well as families with young children, who I am happy to be around. It is very helpful to have access to a physical therapy center just an elevator ride away, so that I can be cared for as I age. In the morning, I enjoy reading the newspaper on my private balcony, and every Friday evening I have dinner at the restaurant with my friends, some of whom live in the building. The rest of my friends and family can drive in and park in the car parking that is rvery close to my apartment and the restaurant, as well as other public facilities.

### Students
I live with three other students, each of us with our own private room, and a shared common space. I have a private bike parking spot, which makes for an easy trip to and from university classes and social events. I like to study in the working spaces and the cafe, and on many Saturdays, I babysit for the family down the hall.

### Starters
My husband and I work in the center of Rotterdam, so the location of our apartment is very convenient for commuting. We have bike parking spots and a car parking spot, and we use both regularly. We live pretty high up in the building and like being able to see the city skyline. Having the gym just a couple minutes away in the building means that I can easily squeeze in some exercise after getting home from work. Also, we're thinking of having a child soon, and the support offered by the nearby care center makes it easier to imagine being new parents. 

### Family
My partner and I have two kids, with our oldest soon entering high school. We appreciate living near elderly residents because their calm presence creates a peaceful environment. Plus, when we’re busy, it’s reassuring to know that our neighbors are around to keep an eye on the kids while one of us runs down to the grocery store or to the gym before dinner time.
