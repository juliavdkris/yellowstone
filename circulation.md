To create circulation routes throughout the building, we first found the center of each function (by mass), and made five clusters using the Houdini cluster function. We then placed elevator shafts on the second and and fourth clusters. We then found the shortest paths connecting all cluster centers to their nearest elevator shaft ends (upper or lower), with cluster center 3 requiring direct lobby access.

The connections between the five cluster functions appear like this:

Below is a visualization where the red is clusters (numbered CL1-CL5), and gray is the elevator shafts and corridors:
