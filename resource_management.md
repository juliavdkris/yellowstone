A biosolar roof will be placed on the roof area that is not dedicated to the roof park. Using a biosolar roof allows for a multifunctional use of roof area -- it at once collects solar energy and has greenery growing on it.

Te overall climate system will work as follows:

Specifically, the biosolar roofs that are not on the roof park will look like this:

## Available roof area
To determine the approximate water collection capacity and solar potential of our building, we calculated the total final roof area. 
    Total: 4,329 m²
    Roof park: 2,790 m²
    Remaining: 1,539 m²
Thus, on our final building, there are approximately 1,500 square meters available for a biosolar roof.

## Solar potential
To calculate the solar energy generation of our building, we used the following formula: E=A×G×η
Where:
- E = Annual energy output (kWh/year)
- A = Total panel area (m²)
- G = Solar irradiance (kWh/m²/year)
- η = System efficiency (panel + inverter losses)

As mentioned before, A = 1500 m². The solar irradience for Rotterdam is about 1,000-1,2000 kWh/m²/year (PVGIS). The system efficiency, η, is set as 0.18 (NREL). These values give us the following minimum and maximum energy output of our building:

1,500 * 1,000 * 0.18 = 270,000
1,500 * 1,200 * 0.18 = 324,000
Total energy output= 270 - 324 kWh/year

This amount of energy output will definitely cover public lighting, possibly in addition to elevators and other building needs.

## Water collection and storage
Since all of our roof area apart from the roof park will be dedicated to a biosolar roof, we needed to look at the water collection capacity of green roofs. This is tricky, as water retention can vary widely, from 40-90%, depending on the type of vegetation, the depth, and maintenance practices (Living Roofs). This water retention estimatin also decreases slightly with the presence of solar panels. Even with trying to maximize the water retention of our green food, there is no guarantee that we would have enough water for extensive use of collection rainwater, such as for flushing toilets or cleaning. Considering this, we decided that water colletion would be limited to irrigation of green roofs (requires minimal maintenance) and irrigation of the public park when there is significant water volume collected. The water collection system would work like the image below:
