To determine the approximate water collection capacity and solar potential of our building, we calculated the total final roof area. 
    Total: 4,329 square meters
    Roof park: 2,790 square meters
    Remaining: 1,539 square meters
Thus, on our final building, there are approximately 1,500 square meters available for a biosolar roof.
