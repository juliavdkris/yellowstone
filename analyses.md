title: Analyses
subtitle: Sun, sky view, hotspot, and noise
---
Five analyses were performed on the voxel cloud that was created previously, with scores being assigned to the voxels for each analysis. First, we performed analyses regarding sun: 1) voxels shaded surrounding buildings, and 2) voxels that were shaded by surrounded buildings. Then, a sky view analysis was performed, which determines the view quality for each voxel. The hotspot analysis looked at the visibility of five prominent architectural hotspots in Rotterdam, and the noise analysis found which parts of the building were most impacted by the sounds of the surrounding environment.

Below is a flowchart showing the general process for the sun, sky view, and hotspot analyses (not noise):
